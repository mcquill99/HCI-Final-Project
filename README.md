# Project SPEEDFORCE
### A Human Computer Interactions Project

It has been 20 years since the first Swarm portal opened on Earth. The only way to close the portals is by entering them and destroying the CORE. 
However, standing still while within the Swarm Dimension is severely damaging. You play as an elite member of the SPEEDFORCE. 
Your goal is to close the portal as fast as possible to reduce damages to earth and yourself.

This is our final project for our HCI class, where 4 of us set out to make an interactive experience with any technology we wanted in 1 month, starting with conception all the way to implementation.

## Design

### Game Demographic
We set out to make a game to appeal to 3 major groups of gameplayers:
- Action Fan: The player who likes to see big action sequences and explosions
- The Casual/Sci-Fi Fan: Players who enjoy the gameplay or aesthetics and want to focus solely on completing the game
- The Achiever/Speedrunner: Players who want to try and complete the game as fast as possible

### Gameplay
Our game is based around two core concepts.
- First-Person Encounter-Based Shooter: Arena style gameplay, emphasis on destroying interesting enemies
- Speedrun-Oriented: Complete objectives as fast as possible, and be rewarded based on how fast you can complete it

### Aesthetic

For our aesthetic, we wanted to create a mixture of organic and industrial structures. Something that would contrast between geometrical structures and organic arachnid enemies to create a dystopian, "overrun" feeling

Our art assets are focused on neon hives of sorts. These work well with our enemy types that come in swarms. And our main level areas seem to come out of a futuristic world, so our contrast works.

### Visual Feedback

The User Interface of the project gives feedback for time, health and ammo

- The damage indicator shows whether you have taken damage and where
- The Weapon Swap menu shows available weapons for the player to use
- The timer shows how long each section of the level has taken the player
